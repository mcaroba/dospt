Requirements

A minimal requirement to install DoSPT is access to a Fortran compiler and
a C++ compiler. "gfortran" and "g++" have been tested to work reliably. If
you are using those compilers and still experince any problems it could be
down to a version issue. Compilation was successfully carried out with
at least gfortran 5.4.0 and g++ 5.4.0 on Ubuntu 16.04.

Note on parallel support

Very basic parallelization is available through OpenMP functionality. If
it becomes problematic for you, try removing the "-openmp" flag from the
"build.sh" file.

Installation

The installation process is rather rudimentary at the moment. For a quick
and dirty installation simply execute the "build.sh" script:

./build.sh

This will compile dfftpack, Voro++ and DoSPT. By default, a directory named
"bin" will be created at the same directory level as this README file with
the DoSPT executable inside. You can add it to your path by adding this
line to your .bashrc file:

PATH="/wherever/you/installed/DoSPT/bin/:$PATH"

To have immediate access to DoSPT simply execute "source ~/.bashrc" in a
terminal. DoSPT will then be available as a command, simply type "DoSPT".

Several options, including compiler choice and compiler optimization,
directories, etc., can be changed by editing the "build.sh" file before
executing it.
